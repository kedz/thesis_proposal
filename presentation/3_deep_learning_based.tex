\begin{itemize}
    \item DL Models of Sentence salience \alert{(Completed)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Experiment with sentence encoder/extractor architectures \alert{(Simpler is better.)}
            \item Ablation studies 
    \alert{(lexical information less important than 
            implicit structural features)}
        \end{itemize}
    \item DL Models of Word salience \alert{(Proposed)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Improve word resprentation for summarization task.
            \item Propose a margin learning framework for word importance estimation.
            \item Propose domain adaption from single-document to multi-document summarization.
        \end{itemize}
