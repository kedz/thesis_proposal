\section{Research Plan}
\label{sec:research_plan}

Table \ref{tbl:researchplan} shows our planned timeline to complete 
the remaining research. We plan to participate in the TL;DR text generation 
challenge  \citep{syed2018task} with our faithful generation method. The TL;DR deadline is
April 1st. Additionally, we would like to publish this work at ACL and so
we will target the March 4th submission deadline.
Work on the word importance estimation is more evergreen and so we will begin
this research in the spring and hopefully finish in the summer, possibly 
submitting to EMNLP or NAACL.
